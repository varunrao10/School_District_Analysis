## Overview of School District Analysis:
The school district analysis has taken the schools and students csv, created dataframes using these csv files and applied a inner join to create a new dataframe containing data from both csv files. Using these dataframes and through the process of data cleaning we have cleaned and organized and presented the data in many ways through methods like loc, groupbys, null data and replace it, conditionals and formatting. From this analysis we have a firm understanding of the relationships between math/reading scores and grade, school capita per student and math/reading scores, school sizes by math/reading scores and school type and math/reading scores.
